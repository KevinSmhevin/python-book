# Write a program named greeter.py.

# then output Hello, NAME! where NAME is the name you entered:


# print("whats your name?")
# name = input()
# print(f"hello, {name}")


# Modify the greeter.py program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, 
# then greet the user with their full name.
